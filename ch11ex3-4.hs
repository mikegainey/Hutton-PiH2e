{- 3. TODO: Alternatively, modify the final program to choose a move that attempts to take the quickest route to a win, by
 calculating the depths of resulting game trees and selecting a move that results in a tree with the smallest depth. -}

{- 4. TODO: Modify the final program to:

4a. let the user decide if they wish to play first or second;

4b. allow the length of a winning line to also be changed;

4c. generate the game tree once, rather than for each move;

4d. reduce the size of the game tree using alpha-beta pruning.
