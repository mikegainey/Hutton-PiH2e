# Hutton-PiH2e
Graham Hutton, Programming in Haskell (2nd ed.).  Chapter exercises and other stuff

I started out doing one chapter a day.  I understood everything very clearly.  This momentum and clarity started breaking down around the abstract machine in chapter 8. Working slowly and carefully, I can say that I at least partially understood everything until chapter 12 (Monads and more).  In chapter 12, I understand Functors pretty well, but Applicatives and Monads were beyond my grasp.

I need a break from Haskell for a while.  When I get back to it, I hope to get further.
